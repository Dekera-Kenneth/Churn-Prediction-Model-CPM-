# Churn Prediction Model
This Jupyter Notebook contains a Churn Prediction Model developed in Python. The model is designed to predict customer churn, i.e., whether a customer is likely to leave a service or product. It uses machine learning techniques to analyze and predict churn based on historical customer data.

# Features
Churn Prediction: The model leverages historical data to make predictions about customer churn.
Data Analysis: The notebook includes data exploration and analysis to understand the dataset's characteristics.
Machine Learning: It employs various machine learning algorithms for classification and prediction.
Model Evaluation: Performance metrics and evaluation are provided to assess the model's accuracy.
Prerequisites

Before using this Jupyter Notebook, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:
Python (version specified in the notebook)
Jupyter Notebook
Required Python libraries (e.g., NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn)
Churn dataset (data source should be specified in the notebook)

# Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook in your Python environment.
Execute the cells sequentially to load data, preprocess it, train the model, and make predictions.
Customize the notebook by modifying the code or adding new features to improve prediction accuracy.
Evaluate the model's performance based on provided metrics and visualizations.
Dataset
Make sure you have a relevant dataset for churn prediction. You can replace the dataset used in the notebook with your own data, and adjust the data loading and preprocessing accordingly.
